[80]Fading in, fading out
[83]On the edge of paradise
[85]Every inch of your skin is
[88]a holy grail I've got to find
[93]Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
[100]Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
[105]Cause I'm not thinking straight
[110]My head spinning around
[113]I can't see clear no more
